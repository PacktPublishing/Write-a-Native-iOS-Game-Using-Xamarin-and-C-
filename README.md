## About the Video Course
Xamarin is the most powerful cross-platform mobile development framework for creating stunning cross-platform applications on the iOS and Android mobile platforms. C# is a simple, modern, general-purpose, Object-Oriented Programming language developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative. 

This video course starts by walking you through an iOS memory-matching game and how to build this using Visual Studio for Mac. Next, you will add game asset images and all the game interface elements. You will then learn how to build the user interface for your iOS Memory Matching game. Here, you will create and add each of the game elements that will make up the visual representation of your game. 


Towards the end of the course, you will implement your game logic to add your game blocks to the view container, and then randomize and shuffle each game block. You will also learn how to implement touch logic to determine when a tile has been tapped on, and then compare the tile with a secondary tile that is tapped. You will then learn how to implement the timer, score, and button actions.
